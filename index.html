  <h2> What is climate change? </h2>
  <p> Climate change is the change in the Earth's climate.  This can be the amount of rainfall, the temperature, or the amount and severity of storms.  The Earth's climate
    is always changing, however, scientists have found that over the past 100 years, the Earth has warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit.  While this might seem insignificant,
    this one degree can make all of the difference.  This slight warming has caused ice caps to melt, raising ocean levels.  Percipitation has increaced.
    The timing of when some plants grow has been thrown off- kilter.  Already species are suffering the effects of global warming</p>
  <p>  If allowed to continue the effects of climate change could be much more drastic.  Percipitation will continue to increace.  There will be more droughts and heat
    waves.  Hurricanes will become stronger, longer, and more often.  It has been predicted that the sea level could rise by 1 to a whopping 8 feet by 2100. </p>
  <h2> What are renewable resources? <h2>

  <p> As shown in the map above, much of the southern United States has a high potential for the use of solar energy. </p>
