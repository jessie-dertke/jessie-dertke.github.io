  <p> A website about climate change, renewable energy, and what you can do to help. </p>
  <h2> What is climate change? </h2>
  <p> Climate change is the change in the Earth's climate, or common weather in different areas of the Earth.  This can be the amount of rainfall, the temperature, or the amount and severity of storms.  The Earth's climate
    is always changing, however, scientists have found that over the past 100 years, the Earth has warmed about 2 degrees Fahrenheit.  While this might seem insignificant,
    this one degree can make all of the difference.  This slight warming has caused ice caps to melt, raising ocean levels.  Percipitation has increaced.
    The timing of when some plants grow has been thrown off- kilter.  Already species are suffering the effects of global warming. (Earth Science Communications Team) (Dunbar)</p>
  <p>  If allowed to continue the effects of climate change could be much more drastic.  Percipitation will continue to increace.  There will be more droughts and heat
    waves.  Hurricanes will become stronger, longer, and more often.  It has been predicted that the sea level could rise by 1 to a whopping 8 feet by 2100. (Earth Science Communications Team) </p>
  <p> Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gasses.  These gasses thicken the atmosphere, allowing less heat to ecape the earth. </p>
  <h2> What is renewable energy? </h2>
   <p> Renewable energy is energy that comes from replenishable sources.  These forms of energy are healthier for the enviroment compared to nonrenewable energy sources, like coal,
     oil, and fossil fuels.  Nonrenewable resources are not only bad for the enviroment, but are being depleated faster than the earth can create them. </p>
   <p> Some renewable energy options are solar power, wind power, biomass, hydroelectric power, and wood.  However, it seems that some states are not taking full advantage of these renewable options. (Stebbins) </p>

  <p> As shown in the map above, much of the southern United States has a high potential for the use of solar energy. However, New Mexico for example, only gets a measly 18% of their energy from renewable resources, as of 2019. (Stebbins) </p>
